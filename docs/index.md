# `erwartung` - just what you expect from your energy system data
`erwartung` (pronounced *ɛɐ̯ˈvartʊŋ*, German for “expectation”) is a collection of data unit tests for the energy domain. It includes software that exports these tests to various formats, ready to be used in your data hub.

## Why is this needed?
Electricity grid operators maintain large volumes of data that describe their assets, such as power lines, transformer stations, and electricity consumers and producers. With the rise of “Digital Twin” concepts, the amount of data has been growing rapidly in recent years. To ensure high data quality, data testing is required. Typical concerns include:

- Correct data types  
- Numerical values that fall within reasonable boundaries (minimum and maximum values)  
- Strings that conform to regular‑expression patterns  
- Quantities of similar assets that are in reasonable ratios  
- Coordinates that match physical addresses  
- And many more…

## Role of LinkML
The Python tool [linkml](https://linkml.io){target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} serves as the core open‑source library that provides export functionality from a knowledge base (schema file) to various formats. Its capabilities can be extended if additional features are required.
