# Graph Data

Graph data can be tested using the SHACL. [SHACL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHACL) is a language to define constraints for graph data. The [linkml Shacl Exporter](https://linkml.io/linkml/generators/shacl.html) can export the data tests from the schema files to SHACL files. With the help of tools like [pyshacl](https://github.com/RDFLib/pySHACL), file formats like `xml` can be tested.
