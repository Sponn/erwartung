# Relational Databases
Relational Databases (like Postgres, sqlite, ...) can be integrated using a LinkML SQL exporter. As of November 2025, an exporter for SQL queries is not yet implemented in linkml, but it is stated as a [plan for the future](https://linkml.io/linkml/data/validating-data.html#future-plans).
