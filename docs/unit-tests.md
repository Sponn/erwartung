title: Data Unit Tests
---



Data unit tests are automated checks that validate individual data records against the rules defined in a data model or schema.  
They ensure that each piece of data conforms to expectations such as required fields, value ranges, pattern formats, and conditional logic before the data is used downstream (e.g., in analytics, simulations, or reporting).

In the energy domain, data unit tests can be used to catch common modeling errors.

??? example "Examples of Test cases"

    * **PowerTransformer rating** – Verify that a `PowerTransformer` entity has a `BaseVoltage` attribute that falls within a realistic range.
    * **Transmission line length** – Ensure that a transmission line entity’s `length` attribute is a non‑negative decimal.
    * **Meter reading timestamp** – Check that a `MeterReading` time attribute follows an ISO‑8601 timestamp pattern.


These tests help maintain data quality, reduce downstream errors, and provide early feedback to data producers.

## Data Modelling
To run the data unit tests in your data hub, both the test and your data need to be expressed using the same data model.  
A test that validates the `power` attribute of a `WindGeneratingUnit` will not work if your dataset uses a different table name (e.g., `Turbines`) or a different attribute name (e.g., `installedPower`).  
In `erwartung`, tests are defined using the **Common Information Model (CIM)**, a data model widely adopted by grid operators.  
To support other data models, `erwartung` provides a mapping template that lets you translate your own terminology to the CIM terms.

## Categories of data tests
In this section, the categories of test cases which can be defined are shown.

### Required attributes
Attributes can be defined as `required`, meaning that tests fail for entities that do not have these attributes:
```yaml
 Tower:
    is_a: Structure
    slot_usage:
      height:
        required: true
```

### Range of attributes
The range of attributes can be defined. Ranges can either be `types` like `decimal` or `string`, or they can be other classes, or types:
```yaml
Structure:
  attributes:
    height:
      range: decimal
```
LinkML provides more information on [ranges](https://linkml.io/linkml/schemas/slots.html#ranges).

### Number values - Upper and lower boundaries
For attributes with a range `decimal` or `integer`, upper and lower boundaries can be set using `maximum_value` and `minimum_value`:
```yaml
 Tower:
    is_a: Structure
    slot_usage:
      height:
        maximum_value: 200
        minimum_value: 0
```
### String values - Regular Expressions

[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) can be used to test string values. They are defined as `pattern`:
```yaml
 IdentifiedObject:
    class_uri: cim:IdentifiedObject
    attributes:
      mRID:
        pattern: "^[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}$"
```


### Rule based testing
All of the above tests can be defined **conditionally**, meaning that they only trigger if some condition is satisfied. In this example, the maximum height check is only triggered if the material is of type `wood`:

```yaml
Tower:
    is_a: Structure
    rules:
      - description: "If a tower is made of wood, its height needs to be smaller than 40m."
        preconditions:
          slot_conditions:
            materialKind:
              equals_string: wood
        postconditions:
          slot_conditions:
            height:
              maximum_value: 40
```
### And More
The tests described above are all part of the core functionality of LinkML. We plan to add more testing capabilities either to the core package of LinkML, or by writing our own software that extends the schemas from LinkML.
