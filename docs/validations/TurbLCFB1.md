# TurbLCFB1
cim:TurbLCFB1

Turbine load controller model developed by WECC.  This model represents a supervisory turbine load controller that acts to maintain turbine power at a set value by continuous adjustment of the turbine governor speed-load reference. This model is intended to represent slow reset 'outer loop' controllers managing the action of the turbine governor.
