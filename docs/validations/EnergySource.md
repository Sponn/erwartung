## Validations

### voltageAngle

Phase angle of a-phase open circuit used when voltage characteristics need to be imposed at the node associated with the terminal of the energy source, such as when voltages and angles from the transmission level are used as input to the distribution network. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero.

### voltageMagnitude

Phase-to-phase open circuit voltage magnitude used when voltage characteristics need to be imposed at the node associated with the terminal of the energy source, such as when voltages and angles from the transmission level are used as input to the distribution network. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero.
