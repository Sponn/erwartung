# ShuntCompensator
cim:ShuntCompensator

A shunt capacitor or reactor or switchable bank of shunt capacitors or reactors. A section of a shunt compensator is an individual capacitor or reactor. A negative value for bPerSection indicates that the compensator is a reactor. ShuntCompensator is a single terminal device.  Ground is implied.

## Validations

### normalSections

The normal number of sections switched in. The value shall be between zero and ShuntCompensator.maximumSections.

- **Minimum Value**: 0.0

### sections

Shunt compensator sections in use. Starting value for steady state solution. The attribute shall be a positive value or zero. Non integer values are allowed to support continuous variables. The reasons for continuous value are to support study cases where no discrete shunt compensators has yet been designed, a solutions where a narrow voltage band force the sections to oscillate or accommodate for a continuous solution as input. 
For LinearShuntConpensator the value shall be between zero and ShuntCompensator.maximumSections. At value zero the shunt compensator conductance and admittance is zero. Linear interpolation of conductance and admittance between the previous and next integer section is applied in case of non-integer values.
For NonlinearShuntCompensator-s shall only be set to one of the NonlinearShuntCompenstorPoint.sectionNumber. There is no interpolation between NonlinearShuntCompenstorPoint-s.

### voltageSensitivity

Voltage sensitivity required for the device to regulate the bus voltage, in voltage/reactive power.
